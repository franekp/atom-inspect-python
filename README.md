# inspect-python
A less-distracting alternative to the common \"go-to-definition\" functionality.

## Setup
Please make sure you have installed the following packages in addition to inspect-python:
 - autocomplete-python
 - hyperclick

## Usage
To inspect definition of a class/method/function/attribute/module,
Ctrl+Click on it's name in the editor. Works only for python now.
DANGER: this is a read-only preview for now, if you edit code of
inspected entity, changes will not be saved anywhere!
